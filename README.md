# Public Feed Map

A map that shows your local area and has markers to indicate where public 
feeds exist. You can click on a marker to pull up the feed. Feeds may be 
cameras, sensors, anything.

## Status

- Geolocation-based Leaflet map working
- 5-mile radius filtering implemented
- Test feeds displayed correctly

## Pause note

Project is intentionally paused.
Core map + radius filtering works.
Next step would be curating additional verified public feeds.
